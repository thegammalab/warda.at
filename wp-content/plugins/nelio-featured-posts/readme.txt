Select the featured posts you want to show at any time and include them
in your theme using a widget.

== Description ==

With this WordPress plugin, you can define a set of featured posts easily.
These featured posts can be added to your theme wherever you want via a widget.

The plugin is extremely simple, fast, and reliable. Once you have selected the
featured posts, they are saved in a cache, so that the amount of database
queries is kept to the minimum.

> **Custom Templates**<br>
> Version 2.0.0 let's you define your own templates for displaying each related
> post. Just create a directory named `neliofp` in your theme's directory and
> create the template you want to use such as, for instance,
> `template-name.php`. When inserting the widget, specify that the template is
> `template-name` and you're ready to go!
>
> **Warning** Remember to save your templates somewhere save before updating
> your theme!
>
> (In the directory `template-examples` you'll find some examples).
