Upload WordPress files directly to your Wasabi & Amazon S3 bucket with ease.

== Description ==

Amazon S3 - Wasabi Smart File Uploads plugin allows you to upload WordPress media files directly to your Amazon S3 & Wasabi bucket using a custom file upload. You don't have to upload files to your server first anymore.

The Free version of Amazon S3 - Wasabi Smart File Uploads plugin offers the following features:

== Upload files directly to Amazon S3 & Wasabi ==
Amazon S3 - Wasabi Smart File Uploads uses a smart way to upload files directly to S3 bucket without using local storage. You won't have to worry about "exceeds the maximum upload size for this site" issue when handling files with large size anymore.

You can upload files as an admin or grant other users permission to upload files to your bucket as per our instructions in the FAQ section.

= Configure & list files on your Amazon S3 & Wasabi Bucket =
You will be able to configure your own Amazon S3 bucket and select where to upload your files to. There is an option that allows you to display other directories in your defined bucket as well.

= Upload multiple files to Amazon S3 & Wasabi at once =
At the moment, you can only upload one file at a time. Multiple file uploads will be supported in our upcoming version.

Our plugin also provides a friendly user interface allowing you to view all your Amazon S3 and Wasabi directories and files within WordPress admin dashboard. You can copy your S3 file URL via right click on the filename.

= Upload files from WooCommerce Dashboard & Dokan Dashboard =
Our plugin integrates with WooCommerce and Dokan plugins to allow users to upload files from the product pages, in addition to our settings page.

== Manage Wasabi & Amazon S3 files within WordPress Media Library ==
You can add not only new file uploads but also existing S3 files to WordPress Media Library.

All files uploaded via our plugin are **private** by default. It means no one can access these files directly even when you set your bucket public.

These S3 files can be managed just like other WordPress media files. For example, you can select and insert them into content through Add Media while editing any page and post.

= Delete S3 files from WordPress Media Library =

By default, removing the file's copy in the Media Library won't affect its original version on the S3 bucket. To remove S3 files from WordPress Media Library, you can define the following constant in your wp-config.php:

`define( ‘SSU_WP_REMOVE’, true );`

= Make S3 files public from WordPress Media Library =

For security reasons, all file uploads via our plugin are private by default. That means no one, even admins, can access the files directly. To make a file public, simply select the option when uploading a file, or right click on the file name and click on "Make File Public" button.

== Protect WooCommerce Products hosted on Wasabi & Amazon S3 ==
Simply insert a raw Wasabi or Amazon S3 URL for files hosted on a private bucket into WooCommerce Product File URL. Our plugin will automatically generate an expiring signed URL for users to download the file after purchase.

This feature requires [Prevent Direct Access Gold](https://preventdirectaccess.com/features/?utm_source=wp.org&utm_medium=plugin_desc_link&utm_campaign=s3-smart-upload) & [S3 extension](https://preventdirectaccess.com/extensions/amazon-s3-wordpress-uploads/?utm_source=wp.org&utm_medium=plugin_desc_link&utm_campaign=s3-smart-upload) to work properly.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are the minimum requirements? =

Minimum requirements for our plugin to work are WordPress 4.9+ and PHP 5.6+

= I’ve installed WordPress Amazon S3 Smart Upload plugin. What should I do next? =

Once activation, go to our plugin's settings page under *Media >> Upload to S3* from your admin dashboard. First of all, you need to configure your S3 access keys in wp-config.php file. After that, reload the settings page and start uploading your files.

= I got "Something went wrong (XHR error)" message when attempting to upload files? =

Looks like you haven't enabled CORS on your S3 bucket yet. Please follow [this guide](https://preventdirectaccess.com/docs/upload-wordpress-files-directly-to-amazon-s3-bucket/#CORS?utm_source=wp.org&utm_medium=faq&utm_campaign=s3-smart-upload) on how to do so.

= How can I allow editors and other roles to upload files? =

Since version 1.2.0, you can permit other users to upload files to your bucket by **define('SSU_CAPABILITY', 'capability')** in your wp-config.php file. Feel free to replace 'capability' with any WordPress capability. The default value is "manage_options", which means only admin and super admin can upload files.

= Is it possible to display file uploads on the destination directory only?=

Since version 1.2.0, if you **define('SSU_FOLDER', 'your-bucket-folder');** in your wp-config.php file, our plugin only displays all files under this folder.

That means you can easily view your file uploads without having to browse through all the bucket directories.

There is still an option to display the entire directories under your bucket as usual.
