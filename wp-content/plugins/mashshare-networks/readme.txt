Buttons are shown exactly where you put the shortcode in.
* For manual insertion of the Share Buttons in your template files use the following php code where you want to show your Mash share buttons:`mashsharer();`
Configure the Share buttons sharing function in the settings page of the plugin.

Mashshare makes use of the great webservice sharedcount.com and periodically checks for the total count 
of all your Facebook and Twitter shares and cumulates them. It than shows the total number beside the Share buttons. 
No need to embed dozens of external slow loading scripts into your website. 
 
= How to install and setup? =
Install it via the admin dashboard and to 'Plugins', click 'Add New' and search the plugins for 'Mashshare'. Install the plugin with 'Install Now'.
After installation goto the settings page Settings->Mashshare and make your changes there.
